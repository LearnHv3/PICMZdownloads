# PICMZdownloads
Repository for the downloadable source code in the book "Learn Harmony v3 for PIC32MZ"

## PURPOSE

This repository contains all of the source code used in the book, **Learn Harmony v3 for PIC32MZ**, by Bill Petrick, (c) 2020 (available from Amazon.com).  All of the source code in the book are labeled with a figure number.  I have copied all of the figures containing source code into one text file (LearnHv3_Figures.txt) located in this github repository.  

When you are working the examples in the book, you will want to copy (rather than typing in) the source code into the appropriate MPLAB X project file.  The easy way to do this is to download the zip-file (containing all of the source code) to your local machine, unzip the file and then copy and paste the Figures as instructed by each example project.

### Download the file to your local machine.
* Select the zip-file, LearnHv3_Figures.zip.  
* Click on the download button to the right of the name.  
* On your local machine, move the zip file to where you want it and unzip it to show the LearnHv3_Figures.txt file containing the source code.

### EXAMPLE: Replacing the text in an MPLAB X source code file
Suppose you are working on the project in Chapter 5 and the instructions say to replace the contents of app.h with what is shown in Figure 5-14. 
* Open the file with your favorite text editor. 
* Scroll down to the figure named in the book (such as Figure 5-14)
* Copy from the file header comment down to the end of that file (or to the next figure).  
* Go to the MPLAB X editor and paste the copied text into the named file (e.g. app.h).
